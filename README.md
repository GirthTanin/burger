# burger
This is my homework for week 14 of my Trilogy Boot Camp at the University of Pennsylvania

## Skill Sets Demonstrated
In this challenge I created application using Node, Express, MySQL, my first ORM and used Handlebars to create a page of reusable elements. Being much more interesting to use rather than recreate oneself, it is deployed also to Heroku.

Meeting standardized file and folder structure was also required.
##To Fork and Play with this yourself
You will need to run *npm install* in the command line to have the node packages that will allow this to run for you.  After you have all the files, at the server.js level use `npm start` or `node server.js` to begin the fun.  Once it is running, from your browser you can interact with it at `localhost:8080/`.
